The assignment operator, denoted by the "=" symbol is the operator that is used to assign values to variables in Python.
Example:
        x = 5
        5 is assigned to x variable
        
        x = 2
        x*=5 
        It is same as x = x*5 => x = 2*5 = 10
        so, 10 is assigned to x
       
        x = 2
        x+=5
        It is same as x = x+5 => x = 2+5 = 7
        so, 7 is assigned to x
