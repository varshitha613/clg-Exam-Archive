In Python, there are five types of function arguments: positional arguments, keyword arguments, default arguments, variable-length arguments, and keyword-only arguments. Here's an explanation of each type with suitable examples:

Positional Arguments:
Positional arguments are passed to a function based on their position or order. The number and order of arguments must match the function definition.

def greet(name, age):
    print("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + str(age) + " years old.")

greet("Alice", 25)
Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old.

Keyword Arguments:
Keyword arguments are passed to a function using their corresponding parameter names. The order of the arguments does not matter as long as they are assigned with their respective names.

def greet(name, age):
    print("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + str(age) + " years old.")

greet(age=30, name="Bob")
Hello, Bob! You are 30 years old.

Default Arguments:
Default arguments have predefined values assigned to them. If a value is not provided for such arguments, the default value is used.

def greet(name, age=20):
    print("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + str(age) + " years old.")

greet("Alice")
Hello, Alice! You are 20 years old.

Variable-Length Arguments:
Variable-length arguments allow a function to accept any number of arguments. These arguments are represented using an asterisk (*) before the parameter name. The function treats them as a tuple.

def calculate_sum(*numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    print("The sum is:", total)

calculate_sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
The sum is: 15

Keyword-Only Arguments:
Keyword-only arguments can only be passed as keyword arguments and cannot be passed as positional arguments. They are specified after a single asterisk (*) in the function definition.

def greet(*, name, age):
    print("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + str(age) + " years old.")

greet(name="Alice", age=25)
Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old.

These are the five types of function arguments in Python. They provide flexibility in how you pass arguments to functions, allowing you to customize the behavior of your functions based on the specific needs of your program.
