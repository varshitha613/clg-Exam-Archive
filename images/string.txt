String:A string is a sequence of characters.Python strings are "immutable" which means they cannot be changed after they are created.
String Operations:

1.count():
	Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a string.
        Example:
             s = "hello"
  	     print(s.count("l"))
           output:2

2.index():
	Searches the string for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found.
        Example:
   	 	s = "world"
		print(s.index("l"))
              output:3
3.lower():	
	Converts all characters in the string to lower case
	Example:
 		s = "HeLlO"
                print(s.lower())
	     output:hello
4.upper():
	Converts all characters in the string to lower case
	Example:
		s = "HeLlO"
                print(s.upper())
	     output:HELLO
